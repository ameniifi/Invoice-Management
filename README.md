Invoice Management System
During my internship at Shamash, I worked on an exciting project of invoice management using Java.

Overview
This project aimed to develop an application allowing users to efficiently manage their invoices. The application enables users to create customized invoices by adding details such as client information, item descriptions, quantities, prices, tax calculations, vendors, suppliers, and even projects and tasks of the company.

Features
Creation, modification, and deletion of invoices.
Integration of filtering and search functionalities for easy navigation through invoices.
Management of clients, credits, products, vendors, and projects.
Persistence of data using JDBC driver oracle ojdbc11 to interact with a database reliably.
User-friendly interface design using Swing components like JFrame, JPanel, JButton, JLabel, etc.
Implementation of event listeners to handle user interactions such as button clicks, menu selection, and text input.
Construction and execution of the application for interface testing and functionality verification.
